The House of Mapuhi
Despite the heavy clumsiness of her lines, the Aorai handled easily in the
light breeze, and her captain ran her well in before he hove to just out-
side the suck of the surf. The atoll of Hikueru lay low on the water, a
circle of pounded coral sand a hundred yards wide, twenty miles in cir-
cumference, and from three to five feet above high-water mark. On the
bottom of the huge and glassy lagoon was much pearl shell, and from
the deck of the schooner, across the slender ring of the atoll, the divers
could be seen at work. But the lagoon had no entrance for even a trading
schooner. With a favoring breeze cutters could win in through the tortu-
ous and shallow channel, but the schooners lay off and on outside and
sent in their small boats.
The Aorai swung out a boat smartly, into which sprang half a dozen
brown-skinned sailors clad only in scarlet loincloths. They took the oars,
while in the stern sheets, at the steering sweep, stood a young man
garbed in the tropic white that marks the European. The golden strain of
Polynesia betrayed itself in the sun-gilt of his fair skin and cast up
golden sheens and lights through the glimmering blue of his eyes. Raoul
he was, Alexandre Raoul, youngest son of Marie Raoul, the wealthy
quarter-caste, who owned and managed half a dozen trading schooners
similar to the Aorai. Across an eddy just outside the entrance, and in and
through and over a boiling tide-rip, the boat fought its way to the
mirrored calm of the lagoon. Young Raoul leaped out upon the white
sand and shook hands with a tall native. The man's chest and shoulders
were magnificent, but the stump of a right arm, beyond the flesh of
which the age-whitened bone projected several inches, attested the en-
counter with a shark that had put an end to his diving days and made
him a fawner and an intriguer for small favors.
